/* Requirements Analysis (English Description)
 * Create a program that will allow a user to calculate
 * how much a customer owes for the fruits they are buying.
 * The user will be given an option to purchase apples,
 * bananas, or mangoes.  Once the user picks one of the fruits,
 * they will be asked how many of that fruit they would like to 
 * purchase.  The customer will then be charged for that many 
 * fruits.  The program should end by displaying the amount they
 * owe for the fruits they are purchasing.  Apple cost 30 cents each.
 * Bananas cost 40 cents each.  Mangoes cost 50 cents each.  The customer
 * can only buy one type of fruit.  If the user enters any other fruit
 * please give them an error message.  
 * 
 * Design (Algorithm)
 * Fruit Stand
 * 1.  Ask the user for the fruit choice
 * 2.  Save the fruit choice
 * 3.  If fruit choice is equal to apples, go to step 4, else go to step 9
 * 4.  		Ask the user for the number of apples
 * 5.		Save the number of apples
 * 6.		Calculate the cost of the apples
 * 7.		Print the cost of the apples
 * 8.		Go to step 23
 * 9.  Else if fruit choice is equal to bananas, go to step 10, else go to step 15
 * 10. 		Ask the user for the number of bananas
 * 11.		Save the number of bananas
 * 12.		Calculate the cost of the bananas
 * 13.		Print the cost of the bananas
 * 14.		Go to step 23
 * 15. Else if fruit choice is equal to mangoes, go to step 16
 * 16.		Ask the user for the number of mangoes
 * 17.		Save the number of mangoes
 * 18.		Calculate the cost of the mangoes
 * 19.		Print the cost of the mangoes
 * 20.		Go to step 23
 * 21. Else if the fruit choice is equal to any other fruit, go to step 22
 * 22. 		Print error message
 * 23. END
